## More about me

I am from Argentina, a Full-Stack developer. Learning around the world. I mainly work with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, building clean and scalable user experiences.

I love working in remote, collaborative environments where I can grow with others and contribute to something meaningful. Iâ€™ve been part of agile teams across different time zones and enjoy pairing up, sharing knowledge, and iterating fast.

Iâ€™m detail-oriented, receptive to feedback, and constantly learning. I believe in continuous improvement, staying humble, and building meaningful things together.

Fluent in English and Spanish, I can adapt and communicate easily with international teams.
